1️⃣ First, classify your tests (this drives DB choice)
A. Unit Tests (Service layer)
*Goal
Validate business logic only.
Characteristics
Repository is mocked
No DB
Fast (milliseconds)
70–80% of test count
Database required?
❌ NO
Tooling
JUnit 5
Mockito

B. Repository Tests
*Goal
Validate:
JPA mappings
Queries
Relationships
Constraints
Characteristics
Real DB interaction
No controllers
Isolated
Medium speed
Database required?
 YES (but NOT Postgres)
Recommended DB
 H2 in-memory

C. Integration Tests (API level)
*Goal
Validate:
Controller → Service → Repository → DB
Serialization / deserialization
Validation
Transactions
Database required?
 YES
Two professional options
H2 (Postgres compatibility mode) → simpler
Testcontainers (Real Postgres) → enterprise-grade
For your stage → Option 1 is perfect

2️⃣ Why NOT use Postgres directly for tests?
Strong reasons:

Problem	              Why it’s bad
Slow	            Tests become painful
Data pollution	    Test data leaks
Non-repeatable	    Depends on existing rows
CI/CD failure	    Postgres not available
Dangerous	        Accidental data loss
